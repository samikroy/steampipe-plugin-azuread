# Table: azuread_identity_provider - Query Azure Active Directory Identity Providers using SQL

An Azure Active Directory Identity Provider is a service that authenticates users for access to applications and services. It provides a way to configure federation and single sign-on, enabling users to use their existing credentials to sign-in to multiple applications. Azure AD supports a variety of identity providers, including Microsoft Active Directory, Facebook, Google, and more.
