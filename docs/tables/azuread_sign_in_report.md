# Table: azuread_sign_in_report - Query Azure AD Sign-In Reports using SQL

Azure Active Directory (Azure AD) is Microsoft's cloud-based identity and access management service. It helps your employees sign in and access resources in external resources, such as Microsoft Office 365, the Azure portal, and thousands of other SaaS applications. Azure AD Sign-In Reports provide details about the usage of managed applications and user sign-in activities.

## Table Usage Guide

The `azuread_sign_in_report` table provides insights into sign-in activities within Microsoft's Azure Active Directory. As a security analyst, explore sign-in specific details through this table, including the location, device, and application used for sign-in. Utilize it to uncover information about sign-in activities, such as failed sign-ins, sign-ins from risky locations or devices, and the verification of user identities.
