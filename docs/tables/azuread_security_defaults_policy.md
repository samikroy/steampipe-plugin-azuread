# Table: azuread_security_defaults_policy - Query Azure AD Security Defaults Policies using SQL

Security Defaults in Azure AD is a set of basic identity security mechanisms recommended by Microsoft. It provides a level of protection to organizations that may not have dedicated security and identity professionals on their IT staff. Security Defaults include requiring all users to register for Azure AD Multi-Factor Authentication, requiring administrators to perform multi-factor authentication, blocking legacy authentication protocols, and more.

## Table Usage Guide

The `azuread_security_defaults_policy` table provides insights into the Security Defaults Policies within Azure Active Directory. As a security analyst, explore policy-specific details through this table, including the status of the policy and if it is enabled or not. Utilize it to monitor and manage your organization's basic identity security settings, ensuring that all users and administrators are adhering to recommended security practices.
